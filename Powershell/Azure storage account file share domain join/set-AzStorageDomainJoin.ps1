# Register the target storage account with your active directory environment under the target OU (for example: specify the OU with Name as "UserAccounts" or DistinguishedName as "OU=UserAccounts,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM"). 
# You can use to this PowerShell cmdlet: Get-ADOrganizationalUnit to find the Name and DistinguishedName of your target OU. If you are using the OU Name, specify it with -OrganizationalUnitName as shown below. If you are using the OU DistinguishedName, you can set it with -OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName. You can choose to provide one of the two names to specify the target OU.
# You can choose to create the identity that represents the storage account as either a Service Logon Account or Computer Account (default parameter value), depends on the AD permission you have and preference.
